# CPPND: Program a Concurrent Traffic Simulation

<img src="data/traffic_simulation.gif"/>

This is the project for the fourth course in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213): Concurrency. 

Throughout the Concurrency course, you have been developing a traffic simulation in which vehicles are moving along streets and are crossing intersections. However, with increasing traffic in the city, traffic lights are needed for road safety. Each intersection will therefore be equipped with a traffic light. In this project, you will build a suitable and thread-safe communication protocol between vehicles and intersections to complete the simulation. Use your knowledge of concurrent programming (such as mutexes, locks and message queues) to implement the traffic lights and integrate them properly in the code base.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 2.8
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* OpenCV >= 4.1
  * The OpenCV 4.1.0 source code can be found [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/4.1.0)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Install OpenCV on M1 Mac
When first trial on build this project on my newly bought M1 MacOS machine, the `cmake` won't finish properly as the library OpenCV is not installed. Here is the instructions on how to do that in a M1 machine.

1. From terminal install `cmake` using homebrew: `brew install cmake`
2. Clone, build, install OpenCV in a new folder *OPEN_CV*
   - `git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git`
   - `mkdir build` in the folder *OPEN_CV*
   - `cmake ../opencv/ .`
   - `arch -arm64 cmake ../opencv/ -DWITH_QT=OFF -DWITH_OPENGL=OFF -DFORCE_VTK=OFF -DWITH_TBB=OFF -DWITH_GDAL=OFF -DWITH_XINE=OFF -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DBUILD_ZLIB=OFF -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF .`
   - `arch -arm64 sudo make -j 4`
   - `arch -arm64 sudo make install`

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./traffic_simulation`.
